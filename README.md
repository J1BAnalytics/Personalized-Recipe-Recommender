# Personalized Recipe Recommender System

This project aims to provide personalized recipe recommendations based on user preferences.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the documentation to start using the recipe recommender.

## Usage

1. Create a user profile by specifying dietary preferences, favorite cuisines, allergies, etc.
2. Get personalized recipe recommendations based on the profile.
3. Explore and try out the recommended recipes.

## Documentation

- [System Architecture](docs/SystemArchitecture.md): Details on the architecture and algorithms used for recommendation.
- [User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md): Steps to set up a user profile and utilize the recommender system.

## Contributing

## Codebase

Implement a Python-based recommendation engine (`recommendation_engine.py`) that utilizes machine learning algorithms or collaborative filtering to suggest recipes. Organize it within a `scripts/` folder.

### Configuration Files

- `Dockerfile` for the recommendation system.
- If using external APIs for recipe data, configuration files for API keys (remember not to expose keys in public repositories).

## Documentation

- `SystemArchitecture.md`: Explain the architecture and algorithms used in the recommendation system.
- `UserGuide.md`: Step-by-step guide on how users can interact with the system and receive personalized recipe recommendations.

## Tests

Implement unit tests to ensure the recommendation engine functions correctly. Example:

```python
import unittest
from scripts.recommendation_engine import recommend_recipe

class TestRecipeRecommendation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_recipe_recommendation(self):
        # Write test cases to ensure proper recipe recommendation
        # Example:
        user_profile = {'preferences': ['Italian', 'Vegetarian'], 'allergies': ['Nuts']}
        recommended_recipes = recommend_recipe(user_profile)
        # Assert the recommended recipes align with user preferences
        # Add assertions here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
