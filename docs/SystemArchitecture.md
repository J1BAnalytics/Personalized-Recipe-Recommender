# System Architecture

The Personalized Recipe Recommender System utilizes a machine learning-based approach to suggest personalized recipes to users based on their preferences. Here's an overview of the system architecture:

## Components

1. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - Implemented in Python (`recommendation_engine.py`), leveraging machine learning algorithms or collaborative filtering techniques.
   - Generates recipe recommendations based on user profiles.

2. **User Profile Manager**:
   - Manages user profiles, including dietary preferences, favorite cuisines, and allergies.

3. **Data Source**:
   - Provides recipe data for the recommendation engine (can be an external API, database, or dataset).

## Algorithm

- The recommendation engine utilizes [insert algorithm name] to analyze user profiles and recommend recipes.
- It considers various factors such as cuisine preference, dietary restrictions, and user history to generate personalized suggestions.

## Integration

- The recommendation engine communicates with the User Profile Manager and Data Source to retrieve and process user data and recipe information.

This architecture aims to deliver accurate and tailored recipe recommendations to users based on their individual preferences and dietary needs.
